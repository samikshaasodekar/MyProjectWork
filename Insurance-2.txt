Insurance-2
In this module, we will learn about risk components which are uncertainty and level of risk, followed

by a discussion on peril and hazard.

Uncertainty arises from incomplete knowledge about future events forming the basis of risk.

While the level of risk is determined by the frequency and severity of incidents.

Parents represent the risks insured against, while hazards are factors that increase the likelihood

of these perils.

Hazards can be physical, like property construction or moral arising from individual behaviors.

Understanding these concepts is crucial in navigating insurance effectively.Today we dive into module one where we clear up the concepts of uncertainty and level of risk.

Both terms considered risk components with peril and hazard, which we will learn about in the next

lecture in this module.

Uncertainty is a component of risk, and it arises from a lack of complete knowledge about the future.

Casting a doubt on forthcoming events.

This forms the essence of the concept of risk.

Since certainty eliminates any element of risk.

If one knows with absolute certainty that their car will sustain a car accident at 7 p.m. tomorrow,

or that they will have a theft incident in their home, there is no risk involved.

The event becomes a certainty.

Since we lack this foreknowledge, we inhabit an uncertain or risky environment where risk exists independently

from the individual.

Level of risk can be realized using two elements frequency and severity.

Frequency, which explains how often an incident will happen.

Take, for example, two houses near a river bank, which is usually overflow, but we are not certain

about the overflow would happen.

The first house located next to the river, and the other away from the river by 400m.

Which one of the houses has more frequent incidents of water damage, do you think?

The answer the closer one.

Of course, because that increases the chances that damage will occur.

Therefore, from this perspective, the first house represents a higher risk.

On the other hand, severity which explains if an incident happened, how bad it will be.

Applying the same example of the houses located near the river.

If the first house, which is close to the river, valued at $1 million, and the one away from the

river valued at $3 million.

Which one of the houses has a more severe outcome.

If the incident of water damage due to overflow of the river, do you think?

The answer the far one, of course, because that increases the severity of the damage occurred.

Therefore, from this perspective, the second house represents a higher risk.

It is important to remember in the process of leveling the risk, it is essential to consider factors

related to both frequency and severity.

The relation between these two factors can vary significantly from one risk to another.

Insurance companies represent the covered risks in relation to frequency and severity as per the following.

High frequency, low severity losses, which are characterized by frequent occurrences of relatively

minor losses in this type of scenario.

Insurers may sustain a large number of small claims alongside a few instances of large losses.

A prime example of high frequency, low severity losses is car accidents in motor insurance.

God.

Accidents happen frequently, ranging from minor fender benders to a more significant collisions.

While each individual accident may result in relatively minor property damage or bodily injury, the

cumulative impact of these frequent incidents can still have a significant financial implications for

insurers.

Due to the sheer volume of claims process, low frequency high severity losses which are characterized

by infrequent occurrences but significant impacts when they do happen.

This type of loss can be illustrated by a chart where there are few instances of losses, but each individual

loss results in substantial financial consequences.

One prime example of low frequency, high severity losses is aircraft accidents in aviation insurance.

While aircraft accidents are relatively rare, when they do occur, they often lead to catastrophic

outcomes involving significant financial liabilities for insurers.

Due to the high value of aircraft and potential for extensive property damage, bodily injury, and

loss of life.

Today we are diving into the concepts of peril and hazard.

These terms are crucial in the insurance industry, and by the end of this class, you will confidently

distinguish between the two.

Let's begin by demystifying peril.

In simple terms, petrol is an alternative word for danger.

It's an event or circumstance that can lead to a loss.

Think of it as the spark that ignites the fire of a potential loss.

For example, fire, water damage and windstorms are all perils.

And yes, these perils are insurable.

We can protect ourselves with home insurance against fire or office insurance against water damage.

Consider fire.

Apparel that gives a rise to a loss.

It's insurable and it could manifest in various scenarios such as house fire or a car catching flames.

Water damage another insurable bidder.

Might result from heavy rain causing floods that damage property.

Windstorms to fall into this category, causing breakage that lead to losses.

Understanding barrels is like translating the language of risk.

Now let's shift our focus to hazards.

The elements that tilt the scale and making adverse events more likely to happen.

Picture.

Aluminium composite panels ACP covering a building's facade.

These panels can intensify the spread of fire, acting as a motivator for the period.

Similarly, sports cars with their high speed capacity becomes hazards for potential accidents and theft.

Perils and hazards are like dance partners, each playing a distinct role.

Perils are the risks we insure against.

Fire, water damage, accidents and more.

Hazards, on the other hand, are the influencers, the factors that surround the beer and make it more

likely to occur.

They are connected yet separate, creating a dynamic relationship that underlines the complexity of

insurance hazards split into two types or categories.

Physical hazard and moral hazard.

Physical hazard, which relates to the tangible features of a risk and involves any quantifiable aspect

of that risk.

Here are a few examples for better understanding.

Property construction quality.

Properties constructed with higher standards offer better physical hazard against fire, as they are

more resilient to damage.

Security measures at a retail store.

Enhanced security measures means a better level of physical hazard, which potentially such measures

will eliminate losses entirely.

On the other hand, moral hazard which comes from the attitudes and behaviors of individuals.

Here are some examples for better understanding.

Carelessness.

A driver's lack of attentiveness can elevate the likelihood and severity of accidents.

Dishonesty.

Individuals with a history of fraudulent or exaggerated claims present a greater moral hazard compared

to those without such history.

Social attitudes.

Social perceptions that does not condemn defrauding insurers contribute to moral hazard.

To sum it up, perils are the risks we cover and hazards are the factors that influence these risks.

The interplay between them is the essence of insurance.In this module, we will discuss two essential concepts in insurance risk pooling and risk sharing.

Risk pooling involves aggregating premiums from policyholders to create a fund used for compensating

losses and covering operational expenses.

It operates on the principle of spreading risk among many policyholders, and leverages the law of large

numbers to predict future outcomes accurately.

While risk sharing, particularly through co-insurance, involves sharing the risk burden with other

insurers or policyholders.

These strategies ensure effective risk management while providing coverage to clients, promoting fairness

and stability in the insurance industry.Risk pooling is a crucial mechanism used by insurance companies to effectively manage and distribute

risk among policyholders.

Let's dive into how this concept works.

Imagine an insurance company as the manager of a large swimming pool.

With each insured individual representing a unique risk.

Likable they throw into the pool upon paying their premium.

The insurance company's task is to manage and operate this pool efficiently.

Each pool is designated for a specific risk category, such as fire liability or motor accidents.

Premium collected from policyholders are pooled together to form a fund.

This fund serves two primary purposes.

One compensation for losses.

In the event of a covered loss.

Funds from the pool are used to compensate the affected policyholders.

For example.

If a home owner's house insured against fire suffers damage.

The pooled funds are utilized to cover the repair costs.

Two.

Operational expenses.

The premiums collected also cover the operational costs of managing the pool.

This includes employee salaries, office rent, equipment maintenance, and other administrative expenses

incurred by the insurance company.

Additionally, insurance companies aim to generate a profit margin from managing the pool effectively.

This involves careful budgeting and risk assessment to ensure that the premium collected adequately

cover both compensation for losses and operational expenses while yielding a profit.

In essence, risk pooling operates on the principle of spreading the risk of potential losses among

many policyholders.

The contributions or premiums paid by policyholders enable the insurer to compensate those who suffer

losses in the future.

Risk pooling also leverages the law of large numbers to predict future outcomes.

This principle states that in a large pool of similar situations, the actual number of events tends

to come together towards the expected numbers.

For instance.

When a flipping a coin numerous times, the frequency of getting heads and tails approaches a balanced

distribution.

Let us illustrate more.

When a coin is flipped, it can result in either heads or tails.

Flipping a coin 20 times could yield any combination of heads and tails.

Perhaps 12 heads or eight tails or any other variation.

Statistically, one might expect an even split of heads and tails because each outcome has a 50% chance

of occurring.

However, flipping the coin only 20 times might not necessarily produce the exact 5050 split we anticipate.

But as the number of flips increases, say to 20,000 times, the result is likely to approach a much

closer approximation of the expected 50% heads and 50% tails.

This phenomenon is the essence of the law of large numbers.

Over a large enough sample size.

The observed outcome tends to be close towards a 50 over 50 split between heads and tails.

Insurance companies use this principle to forecast the frequency and magnitude of future claims within

a pool accurately.

This enables them to set fixed premiums confidently.

Knowing that the law of large numbers will stabilize the outcomes over time.

To ensure fairness and risk pooling, insurers consider various factors known as discrimination factors

when determining premiums.

These factors account for the different levels of risk posed by individual policyholders.

For example, a villa and a high rise tower may face varying levels of fire risk, leading to different

premium rates.

By assessing each insured's risk profile and applying discrimination factors, insurers can determine

equitable premiums that reflect the unique risks brought into the pool by each policyholder.

In conclusion, risk pooling is a fundamental concept in insurance that enables insurers to effectively

manage and distribute risk among policyholders.

By pooling resources and leveraging statistical principles, insurers can provide financial protection

against unforeseen events while ensuring fairness and profitability within the insurance ecosystem.Today we dive into the concept of risk sharing and its types.

Risk sharing is an essential aspect of insurance operations.

But before we dive into risk sharing, let us revisit the notion of managing the pool of money with

an insurance company.

As discussed previously, insurers must effectively manage this pool to ensure that valid claims are

payable.

This involves setting maximum limits of acceptance for different risk categories, known as retention

limits.

Imagine an insurer designing a pool to cover fire risk with a retention limit of $100 million.

If a request surpasses this limit, the insurer has two options.

They could decline the request, but this is often impractical.

Instead, they typically opt for risk sharing with others.

Which comes in two forms.

Coinsurance and reinsurance.

While reinsurance is a topic for an advanced course, it's worth noting briefly it involves an insurer

transferring a portion of the risk they've covered to another insurer.

Known as a reinsurance company.

Now let's focus on co-insurance as a method of risk sharing, which has two types.

Risk sharing with insurers and risk sharing with policyholders.

Co-insurance with insurers.

In this scenario, when an insurer receives a risky transfer request, they can choose to share the

risk with other insurers.

This involves agreeing on terms and issuing a collective policy between two or more insurers.

The premium collected is then divided proportionally among them.

And each insurer accepts a certain percentage of the risk size.

For example, if X insurance offers a share to Y and Z insurers, with Y accepting 30% and Z accepting

40%.

Each insurer will cover their respective percentage of the risk.

During a claim, each insurer pays the same percentage of the less amount they have accepted.

The insurer with the highest percentage of risk accepted, takes the lead in documentation and communication

with the client.

Co-insurance with policyholders in this type of co-insurance, a condition in the policy states that

a certain amount of the loss will be covered by the insured.

This amount, known as excess or deductible, is deducted from the total loss amount claimed.

For instance, if a motor insurance policy has a 300 excess clause.

And the claim for car repair is $3,000.

The insurer will deduct the first $300, leaving $2,700 to compensate the insured.

Moreover, excess or deductible benefits the insurance company by controlling small losses that are

avoidable if they are less than the excess amount.

In summary, risk sharing through co-insurance involves sharing the risk burden either with other insurers

or with policyholders through excess or deductible clauses.

This strategy ensures that the insurer can manage risks effectively while providing coverage to their

clients.

In this lecture we will learn about the terms.

Dual and self-insurance and how each terme works.

Dual insurance occurs when two or more insurance policies are in force covering the same risk.

This situation can arise accidentally, such as when a policyholder unintentionally purchases overlapping

coverage.

Or deliberately, as in the case of goods stored in a warehouse where both the owner and the warehouse

keeper have separate insurance policies.

Accidental dual insurance may happen when, uh, for instance, a traveler buys a travel insurance policy

that includes coverage for personal belongings already covered by a all risks section of their home

insurance.

Deliberate.

Dual insurance, on the other hand, may occur when the owner of goods has a policy covering all their

positions, regardless of location, while the warehouse keeper has a policy specifically covering goods

in their custody.

Although it may seem like duplication, each policy serves a legitimate purpose with no exact replication,

despite the apparent double coverage of the same goods.

Self-insurance refers to the practice where an individual or company opts not to use traditional insurance

as a risk transfer mechanism.

But instead chooses to bear the risk themselves.

For instance, a company with several shops and a consistent pattern of small claims for glass breakages

might allocate a set amount each month to cover these losses internally.

Additionally, the firm can also be used to describe the portion of a loss that an entity chooses to

retain.

Although in this context it typically involves large sums.

For example, a manufacturing company might decide to self-insure the initial $50,000 of each property

loss it experiences.

This amount, known as the retention.

Represents the portion of the loss that the company is willing to cover on its own.In this module, we will explore the primary classes of general insurance, often known as non-life

insurance classes.

Our focus will be on providing a straightforward overview on the main types of policies within this

sector.

We will briefly outline each class of coverage available and its primary sectors of application.

Keeping the explanations simple and accessible without diving deeply into each class or cover.This type of insurance class.

Property insurance provides a coverage for tangible properties or physical assets for the insured.

The following types of policies are the main coverages available under this type.

Fire and alight periods.

This coverage is designed to protect buildings, contents and stock against fire related risks.

as covering liability for damages to other vehicles or property, and bodily injury to third parties.

Liability coverage.

Liability coverage, also known as third party insurance.

Covers the policyholders legal liability for property damage and bodily injury to others in the event

of an accident where the policyholder is at fault.

However, it does not cover damages to the insured vehicle.

Under liability coverage, the policyholder is responsible for covering the costs of repairing or replacing

their own vehicle.

Now let's explore the various coverages available under motor insurance.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of how the insurance market is structured

and get to know the key players who make this intricate industry function seamlessly.

Understanding insurance Market Structures.

The insurance market is an intricate web of interconnected players and mechanisms.

It can be broadly classified into two main segments the primary market and the secondary market.

One primary market.

This is where insurance policies are initially written and issued by insurance companies to policyholders.

It encompasses various types of insurance, such as life insurance, property insurance, health insurance

and more.

Two.
